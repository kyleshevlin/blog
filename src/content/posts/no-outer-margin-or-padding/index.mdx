Building reusable components can be challenging to do well, and there are some anti-patterns that are easy to fall into that can make it even more difficult.

One of the most common antipatterns I see is having `margin` (and in some cases, `padding`) on the outermost element of a component. This is an easy mistake to make, but luckily, it's easily avoided once we know what we're looking for.

### What are "outer" `margin`s and `padding`s?

I define "outer" here as `margin`s that extend beyond the `border-box` of the UI. Generally speaking, this would be applying `margin` to the outermost element of a component.

```jsx
function Card({ children }) {
  return (
    // WARNING: Don't do this! It is an outer `margin`!
    <div style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>{children}</div>
  )
}

function EmployeeCard({ name, occupation }) {
  return (
    <Card>
      {/**
       * This is fine! We can use internal margins for layout,
       * but there are better ways we'll learn later!
       */}
      <div style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>{name}</div>
      <div>{occupation}</div>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

In addition to **never** using outer `margin`, we should **never** use `padding` for the same purpose. The outermost element of a component should not have `padding` **unless** that element has a `border` or a `background-color`.

```jsx
function Card({ children }) {
  return (
    // WARNING! Don't do this! It is an outer `padding`!
    // Without a border or background color, it has
    // the same appearance/effect as a `margin`
    <div style={{ paddingBottom: '1rem' }}>{children}</div>
  )
}

function BorderCard({ children }) {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        border: '1px solid tomato',
        backgroundColor: 'gray',
        // This padding is ok because we have styles that extend to the
        // border-box of our component, thus defining a boundary for
        // this UI!
        padding: '1rem',
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### What's the big deal? Why is this a problem/anti-pattern?

The problem with outer `margin`s and `padding`s like the examples above is that it breaks encapsulation. I've written about [encapsulation](/encapsulation) before, but never in terms of UI. Essentially, styles like these have an impact on the other components around it. Components with outer `margin`s get their elbows out, [NBA Jam style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Jam), knocking around adjacent components.

The impact of these styles often lead to what I call "compensations", essentially workarounds to _undo_ what we've already done. We'll see some examples of this soon.

Not only do outer `margin`s require compensations, they give the underlying component too many responsibilities. External spacing should **never** be the responsibility of a component. Components should only ever be concerned with internal spacing.

### An example

Let's say I have a reusable component called `Item` that looks like this:

```jsx
function Item() {
  return <div className="rounded bg-accent p-8" />
}
```

<div class="my-4">
  <div class="rounded bg-accent p-8" />
</div>

Imagine `Item` is any reusable UI. Perhaps it's an `InfoCard` or a `ListRow` in a list. It doesn't really matter _what_ the specifics of `Item` are, we only need to know that it's a _single unit_ of UI for our purposes.

Let's say I have many `Item`s next to each other. Let's give them different background colors so it's clear which one is which:

<div class="my-4">
  <div class="rounded bg-accent p-8" />
  <div class="rounded bg-pink-500 p-8" />
  <div class="rounded bg-orange-400 p-8" />
</div>

Now that I have many `Item`s, it's necessary to space them away from each other. It might be very tempting to add a `margin-bottom` to each one, like so:

```jsx
function Item() {
  // Notice the `mb-4` class
  return <div className="mb-4 rounded bg-accent p-8" />
}
```

<div class="my-4">
  <div class="mb-4 rounded bg-accent p-8" />
  <div class="mb-4 rounded bg-pink-500 p-8" />
  <div class="mb-4 rounded bg-orange-400 p-8" />
</div>

That _looks_ fine, but we need to look at it with more scrutiny. What if we add a `border` around the wrapping element? What are we going to see?

<div class="my-4 rounded border-4 border-lime-400">
  <div class="mb-4 rounded bg-accent p-8" />
  <div class="mb-4 rounded bg-pink-500 p-8" />
  <div class="mb-4 rounded bg-orange-400 p-8" />
</div>

Oof! We have an extra border at the bottom.

It's at this point less experienced devs start making all sorts of "compensations" to handle this situation. If it's dynamically rendered list of `Item`s, we might be tempted to use an `index` in our loop and somehow remove the `margin-bottom` on the last one. <Marker content="Or even apply a wrapping element with a negative <code>margin</code>. Gross." /> We might even go so far as to add the dreaded `marginBottom={false}` prop, a bad case of [Yet Another Prop syndrome](/quit-your-yapping) if I've ever seen one. <Marker content="Seriously, these kinds of props make me want to 🤮" />

```jsx
// Don't do this. You'll make me cry.
function Item({ marginBottom = true }) {
  const mb = marginBottom ? 'mb-4' : ''
  return <div className={`rounded bg-accent p-8 ${mb}`} />
}
```

But what about other scenarios? What are you going to do if you have to put your `Item`s into a `Row`:

<div class="my-4 flex rounded border-4 border-lime-400">
  <div class="mb-4 rounded bg-accent p-8" />
  <div class="mb-4 rounded bg-pink-500 p-8" />
  <div class="mb-4 rounded bg-orange-400 p-8" />
</div>

Or a `Grid`?

<div class="my-4 grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 rounded border-4 border-lime-400">
  <div class="mb-4 rounded bg-accent p-8" />
  <div class="mb-4 rounded bg-pink-500 p-8" />
  <div class="mb-4 rounded bg-orange-400 p-8" />
</div>

Are you going to make boolean props for all the margins? I sure hope
not!

### The solution

The solution to this problem is simple, use parent elements or components for layout and spacing.

As I said before, it is never the responsibility of a component to manage its external spacing, only its internal spacing. We can always use a parent element or component to manage the layout of adjacent components.

Regardless of what layout solution you use, whether it's with components with something like [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) or classes like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), I find the best solutions heavily use Flex or Grid containers with `gap` to apply spacing. Let's do that here with our `Item`s:

After removing the `mb-4` class from our `Item`, we can now wrap our items in another element to do the spacing. For example, our `Stack` looks like this:

<div class="my-4 flex flex-col gap-4 rounded border-4 border-lime-400">
  <div class="rounded bg-accent p-8" />
  <div class="rounded bg-pink-500 p-8" />
  <div class="rounded bg-orange-400 p-8" />
</div>

Our `Row` looks like this:

<div class="my-4 flex gap-4 rounded border-4 border-lime-400">
  <div class="rounded bg-accent p-8" />
  <div class="rounded bg-pink-500 p-8" />
  <div class="rounded bg-orange-400 p-8" />
</div>

And our `Grid` looks like this:

<div class="my-4 grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-4 rounded border-4 border-lime-400">
  <div class="rounded bg-accent p-8" />
  <div class="rounded bg-pink-500 p-8" />
  <div class="rounded bg-orange-400 p-8" />
</div>

### Summary

- No `margin` on the outermost element
- No `padding` on the outermost element **unless** it has a `border` or `background-color` to visually define the `border-box` boundary of the UI
- Use parent elements or components to do layout instead
