import Example from './Example'

**Disclaimer**: I have no idea if this is a good idea. Just something you can do if you want.

If you're like me, you've been writing React for quite some time. While I don't spend much time writing class components these days, <Marker content="I still work with plenty of class components regularly." /> you might recall that you can pass a second argument to `this.setState`, a callback function that is called after the state update.

This callback function was a simple way to sequence some functionality. Set some state, do something once it has happened. What if we could recreate some of that simple magic with hooks? <Marker content="It's not magic. Sadly, with code as with life, it never is." />

Generally, with hooks we would have this as two parts. An instance of `React.useState` to manage the state changes, and an instance of `React.useEffect` to respond when the state changes. It might even be better and simpler to write your code this way (hence my opening disclaimer).

```javascript
const [state, setState] = React.useState(/* initialState */)

React.useEffect(
  () => {
    // do something with `state` here
  },
  [state]
)
```

We can create a custom hook that encapuslates these two parts. I'll warn you ahead of time. We're going to make a first attempt, run into a problem and fix it later. Let's do this step by step. First our hook function as a wrapper for `useState`:

```javascript
function useOldSchoolState(initialState) {
  return React.useState(initialState)
}
```

Cool. What's our next requirement? That `setState` allow an optional second argument. We can do this by creating a `wrappedSetState` and returning that.

```javascript
function useOldSchoolState(initialState) {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState(initialState)

  const wrappedSetState = React.useCallback((update, callback) => {
    setState(update)

    if (callback) {
      callback()
    }
  }, [])

  return [state, wrappedSetState]
}
```

This looks pretty good, _but_ there's a problem. The `callback` is supposed to run _after_ the state update has taken effect. Which is a perfect word for how we're going to solve this issue, with an `useEffect` hook.

`React.useEffect` always runs _after_ render, and components re-render after a state update. So, if we move the callback to a `useEffect` hook, it will ensure that it runs after our state has updated. We need to come up with a way to store the callback function and call it in the `useEffect` hook.

```javascript
function useOldSchoolState(initialState) {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState(initialState)
  const callbackRef = React.useRef(null)

  const wrappedSetState = React.useCallback((update, callback) => {
    setState(update)

    if (callback) {
      callbackRef.current = callback
    }
  }, [])

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (callbackRef.current) {
      callback()
      callbackRef.current = null
    }
  })

  return [state, wrappedSetState]
}
```

Sweet. Now we can run a callback after the state update. Let's make an arbitrary example. A `Counter` that logs out a message.

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [state, setState] = useOldSchoolState(0)

  const inc = () => {
    setState(
      s => s + 1,
      () => {
        console.log(`Count went up to ${state}`)
      }
    )
  }

  const dec = () => {
    setState(
      s => s - 1,
      () => {
        console.log(`Count went down to ${state}`)
      }
    )
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Count: {state}</div>
      <div>
        <Button onClick={inc}>+</Button>
        <Button onClick={dec}>-</Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

However, one might notice there's a small problem, one that would be avoided in the class component version. Can you spot it?

In class components, `this` refers to the instance of the component, so if we were to try and get values derived from `this`, such as `this.state` and this occurs in a function called _after_ the state was updated, then we would get the _updated values for `this.state`_. But if we try and access `state` in our callback, it will be incorrect. It will be the whatever `state` was at the time `setState` was called due to the closure created. In other words, we cannot access the updated state by using `state` in the callback function. What if the action we'd like to depends on that updated state?

Remember how `useEffect` runs _after_ the state update triggered a render. This means that the value of `state` inside our `useOldSchoolState` hook is when the effect is run is the `nextState` in comparison to the value of `state` at the time the callback was created and `state` closed over. Thus, if we pass `state` in our `useOldSchoolState` to the callback, we'll have access to the `nextState` in the callback. Like so:

```javascript
function useOldSchoolState(initialState) {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState(initialState)
  const callbackRef = React.useRef(null)

  const wrappedSetState = React.useCallback((update, callback) => {
    setState(update)

    if (callback) {
      callbackRef.current = callback
    }
  }, [])

  React.useEffect(
    () => {
      if (callbackRef.current) {
        callback(state)
        callbackRef.current = null
      }
    },
    [state]
  )

  return [state, wrappedSetState]
}
```

Now that we are passing the updated state to the callback, let's update our `Counter` component to make use of this.

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [state, setState] = useOldSchoolState(0)

  const inc = () => {
    setState(
      s => s + 1,
      nextState => {
        console.log(`Count went up to ${nextState}`)
      }
    )
  }

  const dec = () => {
    setState(
      s => s - 1,
      nextState => {
        console.log(`Count went down to ${nextState}`)
      }
    )
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Count: {state}</div>
      <div>
        <Button onClick={inc}>+</Button>
        <Button onClick={dec}>-</Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Excellent. Now our `Counter` will log out the correct value in the callback. However, there is yet one more problem with this approach. What happens if we call `setState` inside of our callback, and furthermore, what happens if we provide this second `setState` a callback as well?

Let's make a new component and try it out. We'll make a contrived `DoubleStepper`, but it'll make my point:

```jsx
function DoubleStepper() {
  const [state, setState] = useOldSchoolState(0)

  cons step = () => {
    setState(
      s => s + 1,
      ns1 => {
        console.log('first callback', ns1)
        setState(
          s => s + 1,
          ns2 => {
            console.log('second callback', ns2)
          }
        )
      }
    )
  }

  return <button onClick={step}>{state}</button>
}
```

Let's break that down really quick. When we trigger `step`, the first `setState` shall update the state by `1` and callback with the next state. Inside of that callback, we'll call `setState` again, which will also update the state by `1` and has a callback that should display the second state update.

But does it?

Try it out and find out. Make sure you check the console.

<OffsetWrap />

Well, what do you know? It doesn't work right, does it? What's going on? Adding a few `console.log`s to our `useOldSchoolState` code will make this clear:

```jsx
function useOldSchoolState(initialState) {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState(initialState)
  const callbackRef = React.useRef(null)

  const wrappedSetState = React.useCallback((update, callback) => {
    console.log('starting wrappedSetState')
    setState(update)

    if (callback) {
      console.log('setting callbackRef')
      callbackRef.current = callback
    }
  }, [])

  React.useEffect(
    () => {
      console.log('starting effect')
      if (callbackRef.current) {
        callback(state)
        console.log('nullifying callbackRef')
        callbackRef.current = null
      }
    },
    [state]
  )

  return [state, wrappedSetState]
}
```

When we click the button of our `DoubleStepper` component, we see the following logs:

```javascript
// starting wrappedSetState
// setting callbackRef
// starting effect
// first callback 1
// starting wrappedSetState
// setting callbackRef
// nullifying callbackRef
// starting effect
```

Notice that `nullifying callbackRef` only occurs once, when we might expect it to occur twice. What's worse is that it nullifies it _after_ having set the ref for the next callback, but _before_ that callback has a chance to be called in the next effect. What we need is a way to sequence callbacks in an orderly fashion. What can we do to manage that?

We can add a simple `queue` data structure, and only process one callback at a time in the queue.

```javascript
function createQueue() {
  const queue = []

  return {
    add(item) {
      queue.unshift(item)
    },
    remove() {
      return queue.pop()
    },
    get length() {
      return queue.length
    },
  }
}
```

This is a very simple `queue` with no bells and whistles. Let's use it to store callbacks, and then `remove` callbacks one by one instead, like so:

```javascript
function useOldSchoolState(initialState) {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState(initialState)
  const queue = React.useRef(createQueue())

  const wrappedSetState = React.useCallback((update, callback) => {
    setState(update)

    if (callback) {
      queue.current.add(callback)
    }
  }, [])

  React.useEffect(
    () => {
      if (queue.current.length) {
        queue.current.remove()(state)
      }
    },
    [queue.current.length, state]
  )

  return [state, wrappedSetState]
}
```

Now, we manage to only run one callback per effect, which in the case of the `DoubleStepper`, gets it working as expected. I haven't tested this on even more challenging scenarios, so I can't make guarantees regarding how bulletproof this implementation is, but I am satisfied with the exploration.

Admittedly, that was quite a bit of work for a seemingly simple hook, but I think the work was worthwhile. It forced me (and hopefully you) to think about breaking the problem down, and fixing pieces of it step by step.
