In 2017, I came across [The Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide) by [Brian Lonsdorf](https://twitter.com/drboolean). It's an incredible resource and introduction to functional programming in JavaScript. It inspired me to start giving talks about functional programming in 2018. After giving the talk several times, I decided to make a course to go along with it. That course is available to you now on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/course/just-enough-functional-programming-in-javascript).

The course is called [Just Enough Functional Programming in JavaScript](https://egghead.io/course/just-enough-functional-programming-in-javascript) and I think you'll like it.

It's a concise, to-the-point introduction to functional programming designed to help you get started and start applying these concepts to your work right away.

Here's what you'll learn in the course:

- Higher order functions
- Pure functions
- Immutability
- Currying
- Partial application
- Pointfree programming
- Functional composition
- Debugging
- And more...

In just 30 minutes, you'll learn more than "just enough".
