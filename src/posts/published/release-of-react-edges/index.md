I had a need to create a custom `Provider` component for a slide deck using `mdx-deck` (if you're interested in learning how to make a custom `Provider` component for `mdx-deck`, check out my [egghead lesson on it](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-build-a-custom-provider-component-for-mdx-deck/?af=8u8eik)). I didn't want to ever have to write it again, so I made a reusable component. After making it, I realized it didn't have to be strictly for `mdx-deck`, so I refactored it into a standalone React component. The library is called [React Edges](https://github.com/kyleshevlin/react-edges). Read the docs, maybe you have a use for it. No biggie if you don't!
