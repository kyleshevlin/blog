import { FootnoteMarker as Marker } from '../../../components/Footnotes'
import LightBulb from './LightBulb'

I recently attempted to get XState into the Webflow codebase to manage some challenging and complex UIs but was met with resistance. No big deal, this is a part of work, consensus driving, disagreeing and commiting, etc. If it hasn't happened to you yet, it will.

One of the things you need when that happens is a good imagination. How do we make the tools we already have do the things we want in a reasonable way? I'm going to help you with that today by showing you a way to make `useReducer` behave like a simple finite state machine in React.

I've started using the following pattern in some of my work and I think it will help you. <Marker index={1} content="A few caveats up front. You won't have access to hierarchical state machines with this approach. You also will not have the ability to trigger side effects from state changes. I will discuss this briefly here, but plan to cover it in another blog post." /> If we look at the `reducer` of `useReducer` and a state machine, we can see that they are quite similar. They both take a current `state` and an `event` (Redux calls this an `action`, but I will use `event` throughout this post), and return the next state. The differences are:

- A `reducer` does not restrict itself to a set of finite states
- A `reducer` has no mechanism for calling side effects from state transitions

We can't do anything about the second point, and I will cover that in a future post on [`useEffectReducer`](https://github.com/davidkpiano/useEffectReducer), but we can do something about the first. We can create a graph of states that our `reducer` will use to transition to the next state. I'll demonstrate how I approach this.

I'm going to use the example of a light bulb like I do in my [XState course](https://kyleshevl.in/xstate). A bulb has three states: `lit`, `unlit`, and `broken`. Let's make a `NEXT_STATE_GRAPH` object starting with these states.

```javascript
const NEXT_STATE_GRAPH = {
  lit: {},
  unlit: {},
  broken: {}
}
```

Next, let's define the `events` that will transition each `state` to their next state.

```javascript
const NEXT_STATE_GRAPH = {
  lit: {
    TOGGLE: 'unlit',
    BREAK: 'broken'
  },
  unlit: {
    TOGGLE: 'lit',
    BREAK: 'broken'
  },
  broken: {}
}
```

Now, we're going to use this in the `reducer` we will pass to `useReducer` to get our next state.

```javascript
const reducer = (state, event) => {
  const nextState = NEXT_STATE_GRAPH[state][event]
  return nextState !== undefined ? nextState : state
}
```

That's it! A `reducer` doesn't need to be complicated or use a `switch` statement. It just has to deterministically give you the next state. Let's apply this to a simple component.

```jsx
function LightBulb() {
  // we can change `dispatch` to `send` to look more like using XState
  const [state, send] = useReducer(reducer, 'unlit')

  return (
    <div>
      State: {state}
      <button type="button" onClick={() => send('TOGGLE')}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => send('BREAK')}>
        Break
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You can see it in action right here. Be sure to click buttons a state _shouldn't_ respond to as well! <Marker index={2} content="You can check out my blog repo for more details on how I implemented <code>reset</code> in my reducer here." />

<LightBulb />

### Types

One small issue I ran into while implementing this was that our type system, Flow, was not happy that I was using the failure of finding a key on an object to return `undefined` on purpose. Type systems hate when you use a language feature like that. No problem, I made a simple fix by adjusting our `NEXT_STATE_GRAPH` slightly.

```javascript
// Let's make an object of all our events with an undefined next state
const NON_RESPONSIVE_EVENTS = {
  BREAK: undefined,
  TOGGLE: undefined
}

// Now let's spread that object into all our states
const NEXT_STATE_GRAPH = {
  lit: {
    ...NON_RESPONSIVE_EVENTS,
    BREAK: 'broken',
    TOGGLE: 'unlit'
  },
  unlit: {
    ...NON_RESPONSIVE_EVENTS,
    BREAK: 'broken',
    TOGGLE: 'lit'
  },
  broken: {
    ...NON_RESPONSIVE_EVENTS
  }
}
```

Now each state node will have a key for any `event`, but explicitly returns `undefined` in those situations where we do not want to make a state transition. This will appease any exhaustive check a type system demands.

### Conclusion

There you have it, a simple finite state machine using `useReducer`. I'll make another post soon on how to handle infinite state data alongside finite states with `useReducer`, but this should be enough to get your brain juices flowing and experimenting with this approach.
