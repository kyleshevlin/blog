Hey everyone! I just wanted to write a really short post to inform you of some awesome things that happened to me this week. As some of you know, the last few weeks I've been trying to get my acoustic EP out on to as many sites as possible, [NoiseTrade](http://www.noisetrade.com/kyleshevlin), [BandCamp](http://kyleshevlin.bandcamp.com), and [ReverbNation](http://www.reverbnation.com/kyleshevlin). It's been a lot of hard work, but it seems to be paying off.

This past week, I received a number of really encouraging emails. Earlier this week, I was contacted by a PR firm here in Hollywood about possibly working together on the press and marketing aspects of my music. A few days later I received an email from a management firm in Santa Monica. And then to top of this awesome week, last night I received an invite to play at the House of Blues in Hollywood next month. **HOW COOL IS THAT!?**

Honestly, it's been one of the coolest weeks I've ever had and hopefully a sign of good things to come with my music. I want to thank all of you for your support. Stay tuned for new material, details on shows (especially the House of Blues) and any other odds and ends I may bring your way. As always, feel free to leave a comment, share with your friends and make sure you download the EP and tell me what ya think!
