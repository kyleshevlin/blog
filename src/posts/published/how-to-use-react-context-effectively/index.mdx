React Context has always been a somewhat controversial tool. It was an experimental API for the longest time, but was eventually made a standard part of the API. Now with React Hooks, React Context is easier to use than ever, but that also makes it easy to use poorly. In this post, I want to go over how I personally use React Context. I think you'll find it succinct and useful.

### What is React Context?

Conceptually, I think of React Context as a **wormhole** component. It's designed to get a `value` from a `Provider` to all its distantly-related child `Consumer`s, without passing the `value` through all the components in between. In short, it's a way to avoid "prop drilling".

### How to create a Context

A Context is created with the `React.createContext` method.

```javascript
const MyContext = React.createContext()
```

My first tip. Don't bother with providing a `defaultValue`. If you're consuming context without a `Provider` higher in the tree, either you're making a big mistake or you know exactly what you're doing. With no insult intended, it's more likely that you're making a mistake and not providing a `defaultValue` will provide a signal that there's a problem you need to fix. <Marker content="The exception to this is if you must provide a default value for a type system. Hopefully the types save your bacon in that scenario then." />

Creating a Context returns an object with two properties, `Provider` and `Consumer`, both of which are components. `Provider`s are parent components that receive a `value` prop that they wormhole to all their `Consumer` children. Here's a quick example using a `ThemeContext`:

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext()

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="light">
      <Header />
      <Main />
      <Footer />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}

function Header() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Consumer>
      {theme => {
        return (
          <header
            style={{
              backgroundColor: theme === 'light' ? '#eee' : '#111',
            }}
          >
            <Nav />
          </header>
        )
      }}
    </ThemeContext.Consumer>
  )
}
```

As you can see, the `Header` component consumes the `ThemeContext` with a `Consumer` component. The `theme` makes its way to the `Header` without needing to pass the value in as a prop. Now that you've seen how the `Consumer` component works, with the component and the render prop API, I want you to forget it. Obliterate it from your memory. I'm going to show you a better way to consume a Context soon enough.

Now that we understand roughly how to create and use a React Context, let's discuss some of the philosophy behind using it well.

### Think locally before globally

It is tempting, once you learn React Context, to use it as a global store. It certainly can function that way and might even be effective, but I personally do **not** think of it this way. At least, it's not my first thought when I need global data.

In my opinion, Contexts should be related to a single concern and not a gathering place for all your data. Therefore, I find I use Context more often when working on a localized concern, such as a particular feature in my app.

It is possible to use globally, but you should at least pause before you do and consider if there's an alternative that might be more useful for your situation. If there is not, then that's fine. Don't sweat it and proceed with Context.

As we'll discuss soon, React Context can lead to a lot of rerenders if the data passed to the `value` prop changes frequently. If I must use a Context Provider at a high level in the tree, such as a `ThemeProvider`, I want to make sure this component does not change `value` often so that my app performs well.

### Always export your own `Provider`

I cannot remember a single time in my years of writing React where there was a good reason for me _not_ to create a custom `Provider` for a context. I do this like so:

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext()

export function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  return <ThemeContext.Provider value="light">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
}
```

Why do I do this? I do this so that I have full control over `value`. I do not want to give users of my `Provider` options that I do not explicitly control. I can give them props that will allow them to alter whatever `value` is eventually set to, but I am still in control. This prevents a number of future problems and encapsulates the concerns of the Context well.

### Expose an API

The point of creating a Context, at least to me, is to define specifically how you want the `Consumer`s to be able to interact with their corresponding `Provider`s. Another way to say this is, if I'm going to provide `Consumer`s with some state, I'm also going to provide them with the `handlers` for that state. I'm a big fan of providing specific state updaters to the consumers of my components, like so:

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext()

export function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState('light')

  const handlers = React.useMemo(
    () => ({
      lighten: () => {
        setTheme('light')
      },
      darken: () => {
        setTheme('dark')
      },
      toggle: () => {
        setTheme(s => (s === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'))
      },
    }),
    []
  )

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={[theme, handlers]}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

This might seem verbose to some of you, but by creating a `handlers` object with specific updaters for the theme state, we can guarantee that our theme state is never updated to a non-supported theme value.

### Create a custom hook for your Context

There was a short window of time where we needed to use the `Context.Consumer` render prop pattern, but I haven't used it since React Hooks made consuming context significantly easier.

Rather than pass my Context object around and passing it into `React.useContext` in every component that needs it, I export a custom hook from the same file I create the Context instead, like so:

```javascript
export const useThemeContext = () => React.useContext(ThemeContext)
```

Now, any component that needs to consume the `ThemeContext` can import `useThemeContext` and use it. Like so:

```jsx
function Header() {
  const [theme, { toggle }] = useThemeContext()

  return (
    <header
      style={{
        backgroundColor: theme === 'light' ? '#eee' : '#111',
      }}
    >
      <Nav />
      <button onClick={toggle}>Toggle theme</button>
    </header>
  )
}
```

### Optimize components that consume your custom hook

From the React docs:

> All consumers that are descendants of a Provider will re-render whenever the Provider’s `value` prop changes.

Remember that quote. All Consumers rerender when the Provider updates, _regardless of whether it is necessary or not_. This means, if you're not careful, you could be causing a lot of unnecessary rerenders in your application. React makes us, the users of React, responsible for preventing unnecessary rerenders, so how do we do this for components that consume a context?

There are primarily two ways to accomplish. Both use memoization but in different ways.

The first way is to turn the component that consumes the context into a "container component" and to use `React.memo` on the "presentational component" that the container returns. Like so:

```jsx
export function HeaderContainer({ children }) {
  const [theme, { toggle }] = useThemeContext()

  return <Header theme={theme} toggleTheme={toggle} />
}

const Header = React.memo(function Header({ theme, toggleTheme }) {
  return (
    <header
      style={{
        backgroundColor: theme === 'light' ? '#eee' : '#111',
      }}
    >
      <Nav />
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle theme</button>
    </header>
  )
})
```

This works because we turn the `value` of the context into `props` that are passed to a memoized component. The memoized component only updates if the `props` change.

The second technique does not require an extra component, but instead uses `React.useMemo` to memoize what we return from the component that consumes the context. Like so:

```jsx
function Header() {
  const [theme, { toggle }] = useThemeContext()

  return React.useMemo(
    () => (
      <header
        style={{
          backgroundColor: theme === 'light' ? '#eee' : '#111',
        }}
      >
        <Nav />
        <button onClick={toggle}>Toggle theme</button>
      </header>
    ),
    [theme, toggle]
  )
}
```

This strategy works by memoizing the output of our component. It only recalculates our output if one of the `ThemeContext` related values changes. <Marker content="It is likely someone will say, &ldquo;That's not true!&rdquo; and they would be pedantic, but also correct. The React docs mention that values memoized with <code>useMemo</code> might be recalculated without the dependencies changing, but it works how we expect most of the time and will never calculate incorrectly, so don't worry about it." />

### Summary

That's it. That's how I use React Context effectively. To recap:

- Don't worry about a default value
- Think locally and small before globally
- Make your own Provider
- Expose an API
- Export a custom hook, don't bother with a Consumer render prop component
- Memoize the components that consume the context, either by:
  - Container and `React.memo`ized presentational components
  - `React.useMemo` the component's output

Hope this helps you use React Context more effectively in your apps.
