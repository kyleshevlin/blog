This one will be short and to the point. I recently ran into a problem while trying to create a debounced callback with React hooks. If you're using the `react-hooks` ESLint package with the recommended settings, then it will warn you that you can't do the following:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { debounce } from 'lodash'

function Search({ onSearch }) {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('')

  const debouncedSearch = React.useCallback(
    debounce(val => {
      onSearch(val)
    }, 750),
    [onSearch]
  )

  const handleChange = React.useCallback(
    e => {
      setValue(e.target.value)
      debouncedSearch(e.target.value)
    },
    [debouncedSearch]
  )

  return <input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
}
```

This _looks_ fine, but here's the warning:

> Error: React Hook useCallback received a function whose dependencies are unknown. Pass an inline function instead react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

`useCallback` expects an inline function. Handing it the returned function from a `debounce` or `throttle` doesn't cut the mustard. Why? The ESLint rule can't figure out what the exhaustive dependencies should be. How do we fix this?

It might seem odd, but `useMemo` comes to the rescue.

```jsx
function Search({ onSearch }) {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('')

  const debouncedSearch = React.useMemo(
    () =>
      debounce(val => {
        onSearch(val)
      }, 750),
    [onSearch]
  )

  const handleChange = React.useCallback(
    e => {
      setValue(e.target.value)
      debouncedSearch(e.target.value)
    },
    [debouncedSearch]
  )

  return <input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
}
```

Think about it. `useMemo` is used to store a memoized value that should only be recalculated when the dependencies change. So what if that memoized value is a function?

It wasn't obvious to me to do this at first, but it makes sense. We want the returned function, and we want it to have the correct exhaustive dependencies, and update whenever they change. `useMemo` does exactly that.

You can use this same technique with `throttle`, too. Really any higher ordered function that returns a function. Sky is the limit.
