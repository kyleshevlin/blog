Back in September, I tweeted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Friends, help me out. I'm starting a podcast called "Second Career Devs". Who are some great second career devs/engs I should interview?</p>— Kyle Shevlin (@kyleshevlin) <a href="https://twitter.com/kyleshevlin/status/906201169495605248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2017</a></blockquote>

I'm proud to say that I finally was able to launch the podcast. I welcome you to follow Second Career Devs on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/second-career-devs/id1317467797?mt=2) and subscribe.

If you're not a fan of iTunes, you can listen either via the [Second Career Devs website](https://secondcareerdevs.com) or on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/secondcareerdevs). Whatever way you can, I encourage you to listen, leave a review, and if you know of someone who'd be great on the show, please let me know!
