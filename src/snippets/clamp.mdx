```javascript
const clamp = (min, max) => number => Math.min(Math.max(min, number), max)
```

I have found this function useful again and again in my career, often serving as a way to prevent broken number values from getting somewhere without being to obtrusive to the user.

It can take a moment to understand how `clamp` works because it's a bit counterintuitive. We make use of `Math.min` and `Math.max` to accomplish `clamp`.

`Math.min` will return you the _minimal_ value of a set of numbers.

```javascript
console.log(Math.min(76, 24, -42)) // -42
```

`Math.max` will return to you the _maximal_ value of a set of numbers.

```javascript
console.log(Math.max(76, 24, -42)) // 76
```

Therefore, we can create a `clamp` by composing these together. First we make sure that the number is not below our `min` with:

```javascript
const minThresholdResult = Math.max(min, number)
```

You can hopefully see that if `number` is less than `min`, `Math.max` will return `min`, therefore clamping the result to the `min` value. We pass this result into our next check, ensuring the value is not above `max` with:

```javascript
const result = Math.min(minThresholdResult, max)
```

If the value of `minThresholdResult` is higher than our `max` value, it will clamp it to the `max` value of our range, otherwise it will return our value.

Here it is in use:

```javascript
const between0and100 = clamp(0, 100)

const numbers = [42, 142, -42]

numbers.forEach(number => {
  console.log(between0and100(number))
})

// 42
// 100
// 0
```
